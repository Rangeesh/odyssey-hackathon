# Documentation Location

All markdown documentation files (`*.md`) MUST be placed in the `docs/` directory.

## Exceptions

- `README.md` should remain in the project root.
- `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` should remain in the project root.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if applicable) can remain in the project root or `.github/`.

## Rules

1. When creating new documentation, always create it in `docs/`.
2. If you find documentation files in the root (other than exceptions), move them to `docs/`.
3. Update links in other files if you move documentation.
